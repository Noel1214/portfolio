            I am Noel Sebu, a self-taught MERN Stack Developer with a strong
            interest in building user-friendly and scalable web applications.
            Iâ€™ve worked on real-world projects, including a freelance job for a
            tuition center and a job-related project, and also completed an
            internship to gain hands-on experience. I work with technologies
            like React.js, Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, GSAP, and
            tools like Git, GitHub, Vercel, and AWS. I enjoy learning new tools
            and frameworks and focus on clean design, performance, and
            accessibility in every project.
